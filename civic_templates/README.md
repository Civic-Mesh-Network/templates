# Civic Templates â€” People-First Mesh Layer

This folder contains ready-to-use templates for **forming the human layer** of a Civic Mesh.

## Purpose
While `playbooks/rf` shows how to build radio links and `schema/` describes data models,
these templates show **how to organize people** â€” the social and governance layer that makes
the mesh more than just infrastructure.

## Contents
- **Neighborhood_Charter_Template.md** â€” founding document for shared principles.
- **Anchor_Partnership_Agreement.md** â€” how to partner with local orgs or sites.
- **Civic_Forum_Guide.md** â€” how to host inclusive meetings.
- **Volunteer_Roles_and_Rituals.md** â€” sample roles for distributing work and spirit.
- **Consensus_Building_Guide.md** â€” practical guide to collective decision-making.

## How to Use
1. Copy the files into your own neighborhood mesh repo.
2. Edit names, dates, and practices to match your local context.
3. Commit them under `governance/` or `docs/` in your repo.
4. Share improvements back via PR to this federation repository.
