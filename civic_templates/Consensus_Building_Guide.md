# Consensus Building Guide
Practical method for neighborhood decision-making.

1. **Present Issue** – clear, one-line framing.
2. **Circle Speak** – each person responds without interruption.
3. **Harvest Agreements** – note shared principles.
4. **Surface Concerns** – note blockers, propose mitigations.
5. **Test Consent** – “Can you live with this?”
6. **Document Decision** – record and post publicly.

> Consensus is not unanimity. It’s collective willingness to move forward.
